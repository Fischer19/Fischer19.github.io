I'm currently a second year master student at University of California, San Diego. I study Machine Learning and Data Science in ECE department. Previously, I graduated from New York University Shanghai with honors in Data Science. I also received BS in Honors Mathematics from NYUSH and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~benarous/" target="_blank">Gerard Ben Arous</a>.
